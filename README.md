Explanation of the problem and the solution

## Report

Highlight difference in results when cutting out the excess of the genotype
after the agent dies. If we do cut it out, the number of times a solution is
found is lower, but the quality of the solution is usually better. When we
don't, we find the solution more often, although, it usually has a lot of
unnecessary steps and is of lower quality.
